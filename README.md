### Introduction
  A movie site dedicated to showing details and accuarte ratings of the recently released movies.

### Goals

### Challenges

### Reflections / Lessons Learned
Asynchronous JavaScript is a difficult concept to understand and takes lots of practice. However, throughout the project we got more comfortable with this concept and testing it.

Future features we would like to impletment include:
  - Filtering by genre
  - Incorporating movie trailers in movie details
  - Incorporating Express.js



### Final Outcome
Your homepage will be a view of all recently released movies. You can select a movie and be taken to that movies details. You can also search by the move title using the search bar. Demonstration in the gif below.
